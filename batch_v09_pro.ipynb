To finance this endeavor, he secured a total of one million dollars from various investors and sources. After an extensive search for an undeveloped parcel of land suitable for his project, he found that no vacant lots met his criteria. Consequently, he decided to purchase a developed property, which already had structures on it, with the intention of demolishing the existing buildings and constructing the new apartment complex. However, this plan was not initially budgeted for, as the developer had not anticipated the additional expenses associated with acquiring a developed lot and removing existing structures. After a thorough search, he bought a sizable lot containing a single-story residential house for $200,000 and spent an additional $50,000 to demolish the house. The estimated cost to build the apartment was approximately $850,000, prompting the developer to seek an extra $100,000 from an investor. The investor was hesitant because the developer had not yet secured a construction company to undertake the building. They agreed in writing that the investor would lend $100,000 at 5% interest within 30 days, contingent upon the developer hiring a contractor to build the apartment for no more than $850,000. The loan would be repaid at $1,000 monthly installments starting one month after the project's completion, secured by a mortgage on the property. The developer contracted a construction firm to build the apartment for $800,000.

She reached out to several plant suppliers but found that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported into the United States. Knowing a distributor with connections in Japan, she inquired whether it was possible to obtain one directly from Japan. After consulting with authorities both locally and in Japan, the distributor confirmed he could procure the plant for her. They then entered into a contract where the distributor agreed to source the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, ship it to the U.S., and plant it in her garden for a total cost of $5,000. The agreement specified that the plant would be installed within six months, with the woman paying $1,000 upfront at signing and the remaining $4,000 upon planting. She provided a check for the initial payment. However, two weeks later, officials discovered that a beetle species harmful to citrus crops had adapted to nesting in cymbidiums, laying eggs that could take up to a year to hatch.

Keep the JSON format in the output with '{' and '}'.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '{\"instruction\": \"Above an infinitely large plane carrying charge density \\\\u03c3, the electric field points up and is equal to \\\\u03c3/2\\\\u03b5o.
