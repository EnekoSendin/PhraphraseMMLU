Desiring to have one of these cymbidiums planted in her garden, she contacted a number of plant distributors, only to discover that this particular cymbidium had not yet been imported to the United States. She contacted a plant distributor, who she knew had ties to Japan, and asked if it would be possible to acquire one of these cymbidiums from Japan. After checking with local and Japanese authorities, the distributor determined that he could indeed acquire the plant for the woman. The parties then signed a contract that stated the distributor would acquire the cymbidium from a nursery in Japan, have it shipped to the United States and have it planted in the womans garden for the price of $5,000. The distributor promised that the plant would be in place within six months, and the woman promised to pay $1,000 at the time of the execution of the contract and$4,000 when the cymbidium was planted in her garden. The woman then handed a check for $1,000 to the distributor.

The female beetle would lay eggs among the roots of the cymbidiums, and it would sometimes take up to one year for the eggs to hatch.

The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.And the mine owners keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha corn beer\\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.There is no remedy for all this, because any colonial official who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him\\u2026.Even the protector of the Indians is useless;\\u2026he does not warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia court about the harms done to the poor Indians.Excerpt from The First New Chronicle and Good Government abridged, by Felipe Guaman Poma de Alaya.
